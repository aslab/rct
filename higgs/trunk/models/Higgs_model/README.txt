IMPORTANT!!
If you are using RSA 8:
when opening this model please DO NOT update to the newer version of the UML profile.
You can still manipulate the model without doing so.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a modeling project of RSA containing the models of the Higgs Autonomous
Navigation application, which for the moment are 2:
-HiggsEngineeringModel contains a UML model used by the engineers to develop the application
-HiggsRunningModel is the model that the system will use at runtime for self-reflection and failure-recovery

The model ROS_higgs_model_deprecated_alternative is an obsolete attempt to model
the ROS implementation of the Higgs Autonomous navigation application.
