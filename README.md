The Robot Control Testbed (RCT) is a collection of robotics research platforms that are developed inside the the ASLab ASys project. These platforms are used to deply and evaluate different classes of developments in robotic system autonomy. 

The Higgs subproject contains software for the Higgs robot, a multisensorized mobile robot used for physical tests.

The MRT subproject contains a ROS package that provides a simulation testbed for multirobot coopration - a UAV and a UGV in Gazebo.
